# Oblique Strategies Plugin

Share Oblique Strategies - the creative prompts created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt to help break through creative blocks.

## What are Oblique Strategies?

Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards created by musician Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt in 1975. Each card contains a cryptic remark or suggestion intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative deadlocks by encouraging lateral thinking.

## Installation

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/oblique-strategies
```

Or copy to your project's `.claude-plugin/` directory.

## Usage

The skill triggers when you:
- Say "I'm stuck"
- Ask for "an oblique strategy"
- Need "creative inspiration"
- Want to "think differently"
- Request "a random idea"

## Example

```
You: I'm stuck on this design problem

Claude:
---
**Oblique Strategy:**

> Honor thy error as a hidden intention

```

## Credits
